# Chert

This is a iOS keyboard built off of the [Tasty Imitation Keyboard](https://github.com/archagon/tasty-imitation-keyboard). Chert is a fully functional keyboard that can be customized to contain character sets for Alaska Native languages.

This keyboard is currently optimized for iPhone. iPad should work, but it'll look like a giant iPhone keyboard.

## Features

* Auto-capitalization, period shortcut, keyboard clicks.
* Dark mode and solid color mode.
* Completely customizable to include only the languages you want.

## Current State

Chert is on the App Store and can be found [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chert-alaskas-native-language/id1126409399?ls=1&mt=8).

## Install Instructions

1. Go to `Settings → General → Keyboard → Keyboards → Add New Keyboard` on your device and add the third-party keyboard.
2. Go back to the app. Press the globe icon until you reach the Chert keyboard (it has an arrowhead on top of it).

## Contact

If you are interested in using Chert to create your own app, especially if it is for a Native language, please don't heistate to reach out. I would love to work with anyone particularly if you're involved in Native language revitalization. You can reach me at chert.developer@gmail.com.
